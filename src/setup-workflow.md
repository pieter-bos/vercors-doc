# Workflow

Since VerCors is made by Real Humansâ„¢ we agreed on some administrative conventions to stick by:

* If you have a bug or clearly delineated feature request, it should exist as an issue on our tracker on GitHub: <https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/issues>. The goal is to have zero issues: that should be achievable, since it should be clear what to do from the issue.
* If you have a more vague feature request, or a question, or you're not sure if something is a bug, it should be a discussion: <https://github.com/utwente-fmt/vercors/discussions>.
* If you're working on VerCors code longer term, we prefer that you do so in a _branch_ in the main repository, rather than working in a fork. Please ask for push access when starting out.
* If you're working on a single issue, please assign yourself the issue. 
* We use feature branches and pull requests, so once you're done please file a pull request. Contiuous integration will run all examples on your changes automatically, so it's wise to check if it succeeded.
* We do not have a linting policy at this time. We ask that try to follow local conventions of files you're editing and do not reformat whole files.
